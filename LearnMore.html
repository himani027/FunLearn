            <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
            <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.</p>
           
            <p>The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.</p>
            
            <p>The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. </p>
